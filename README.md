# Predicting-National-Happiness-A-Linear-Regression-Analysis-Using-Human-Development-Index

This ipynb file entails a mini project that demonstrates the application of the Linear Regression Model on two datasets: 
(1) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/human-development-index-dataset
(2) https://github.com/PhilippeCodes/World-Happiness-Report-Data-Analysis/blob/master/World%20Happiness%20Report.csv

The system takes the Human Develoment Index (2021) from (1) and the Happiness Score from (2) and fits a Linear Regression model on the positive correlation between them. This model is then used to predict the Happiness Score of a country not included in (2), specifically Tuvalu.
